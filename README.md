# calculator-cli
A simple Python command line calculator

How it works 
1. input(): reads text typed by you.
2. float(): converts the text into a number (allows decimals).
3. try/except: handles invalid input so the program doesn't crash.
4. The program loops so you can do many calculations; type q to quit.
